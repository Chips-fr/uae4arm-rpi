      sudo apt-get install libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
      sudo apt-get install libsdl-gfx1.2-dev
      sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
      sudo apt-get install libflac-dev
      sudo apt-get install libmpg123-dev
      sudo apt-get install libmpeg2-4-dev

   Then for Raspberry Pi 2:  

      make

   Or for Raspberry Pi 3:  

      make PLATFORM=rpi3

   Or for Raspberry Pi 1:  

      make PLATFORM=rpi1



How to compile on Raspbian Whezzy:  

   You need to install same packages as Jessie (see above)
   and a more updated gcc (otherwise alter Makefile).
   In order to do this enter the following in command line:  

      sudo apt-get install g++-4.8


   Then for Raspberry Pi 2:  

      make CXX=g++-4.8

   Or for Raspberry Pi 3:  

      make PLATFORM=rpi3 CXX=g++-4.8

   Or for Raspberry Pi 1:  

      make PLATFORM=rpi1 CXX=g++-4.8
